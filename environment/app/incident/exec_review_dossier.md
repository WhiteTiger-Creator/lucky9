# Warden Badge-Access Review Dossier

Working record of the access-control review board. The containment rollup deployed during the Warden incident is producing an unreliable responder queue; how the rollup is *meant* to behave was settled here incrementally, not in any single summary. February triage proposals were partly reversed during the March working sessions and several March positions were revised again in the May close-out, so trace each rule to its final dated decision. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` is the output contract only: it fixes file names, key sets and checksum serialization, not how any value is derived.

> **Board decision (2026-05-08 - PX-3318)** Baptiste: duplicate exec rows (final, REVERSING PX-3212). Repeated `exec_id` values arrive when a reader retries an unlock, and the retry re-stamps the credential at the higher class before the escort has confirmed it. So on a duplicate the LOWER exec class wins, not the higher. Resolve in order: keep the greater `started_ms`; on a tie the LOWER exec class by the ranking system > service > batch > adhoc; then the LONGER normalized binary string; then the lexicographically greater host. Deduplication happens BEFORE any count, aggregate or checksum.

> **Board decision (2026-05-11 - PX-3320)** Moreau: session stitching (final, revising PX-3244). The stitch gap is retuned to 140 ms: execs merge into one occupancy session while `next.started_ms <= current.end_ms + 140`. The 60 ms allowance assumed a exec-and-walk cadence the Warden binarys do not have, and it was splitting single occupancies in two. Sessions are built per host over canonical rows in `started_ms` order.

> **Board decision (2026-05-22 - PX-3332)** Moreau: containment admission (final). A session joins the containment queue when its `ledger_runtime_ms` reaches the admission floor for its `lead_class`: system 150, service 190, batch 240, adhoc 300. The floors sit directly on the observed ledger distribution, so a one-unit slip anywhere upstream moves a session across the boundary. Priority is then `critical` when `ledger_runtime_ms >= 420`, or when `lead_class` is `system` with `sandbox_overlap_ms > 0`; otherwise `urgent` when `ledger_runtime_ms >= 300` or `exec_count >= 3`; otherwise `normal`.

> **Board decision (2026-05-25 - PX-3334)** Baptiste: queue ordering and capacity (final). The containment queue is ordered strictly by this chain: priority rank `critical` > `urgent` > `normal`; then `ledger_runtime_ms` descending; then `runtime_ms` descending; then `exec_count` descending; then `host` ascending; then `start_ms` ascending. This is an ordering, not ascending entry time.
> **Board decision (2026-05-28 - PX-3338)** Sato: audit deduction rounding. The audit half of the runtime deduction now ROUNDS UP (ceiling), matching the sandbox half: `adjusted_runtime_ms = max(runtime_ms - ceil(sandbox_overlap_ms / 2) - ceil(audit_used_ms / 3), 0)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/3) is -(-x // 3). This revises the floored `audit_used_ms // 3` written in PX-3328, which is superseded on this point only: the LOCKDOWN precedence, the shared-span subtraction, the divisors 2 and 3, and the unadjusted reporting of both overlaps are unchanged. ROUNDING: audit_used_ms // 3 = CEIL.
> **Board decision (2026-05-30 - PX-3340)** Ferrara: occupancy carry credit rounding. The carry credit applied to a session's ledger runtime now ROUNDS UP (ceiling): `ledger_runtime_ms = adjusted_runtime_ms + ceil(carry_in_ms / 5)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/5) is -(-x // 5). This revises the floored `carry_in_ms // 5` recorded in the occupancy-ledger ruling, which is superseded on this point only: the idle decay, the carry-out cap and the exec-count term are unchanged. ROUNDING: carry_in_ms // 5 = CEIL.

> **Board decision (2026-05-27 - PX-3330)** Ferrara: responder capacity cap (final). Responders cannot work more than two occupancies per host in one containment pass, so the queue is capped at two rows per host. The cap is applied AFTER the full ordering of PX-3334, and the rows that survive are the two highest-ranked in that GLOBAL order — not the first two by start time and not a per-host ranking. `contained_count`, `priority_counts` and `containment_checksum` are all computed from the capped queue.
